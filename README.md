# Creating SSH Keys

## GitBash

### Getting Started

- `pwd` - Shows current folder
- Navigate to main folder `/c/Users/(profile_name)`
- `ls` - shows folders within current directory
- `ls -a` - shows hidden folders and files within directory that begin with . (e.g. .ssh).

#### If SSH folder doesn't exist (should only need to be done once):

- `mkdir .ssh` - Makes a directory (.ssh is name given to directory).



`git remote set-url origin (URL from github)`
